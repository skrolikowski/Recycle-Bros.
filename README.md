# Major Jam 3: Retro
A game made for the [Major Jam 3: Retro](https://itch.io/jam/major-jam-3) Game Jam hosted on [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

### Limitation
96x96 screen resolution

The game must have a maximum resolution of 96 pixels by 96 pixels. Imagine you're making a game for a console that has a screen of this size. You'll want to keep in mind which elements need more room and how small you can make any given element on screen before they blur into the background.
